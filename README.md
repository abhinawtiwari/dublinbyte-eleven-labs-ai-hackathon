# ReacTok for ElevenLabs AI Hackathon - Engage Your TikTok Fans with Your Alter Ego Bot!

## Introduction:

Welcome to ReacTok, an innovative Generative AI Prompt-to-Speech platform designed to enhance engagement and boost monetization for TikTok Creators during their live streams. ReacTok empowers TikTok Creators to interact with their fans through a personalized bot, portrayed by their own Alter Ego, responding to comments with the Creator's voice. This exciting and fun interaction mechanism allows Creators to create a more interactive and rewarding experience for their fans, encouraging them to send virtual gifts and fostering a stronger fan community.

## Objective:

The main objective of ReacTok is to enable TikTok Creators to amplify their engagement during live streams by utilizing an AI-powered bot that communicates with their fans in real time. By embodying their Alter Ego, Creators can respond to comments, perform actions, and nudge their fans to send virtual gifts their way, creating an immersive experience that keeps their audience entertained and captivated throughout the livestream.

## Interaction Mechanism (Minimum Viable Product - MVP):

With ReacTok, the process is simple and effective. When the Creator starts a live stream, their fans can access a web app to engage in a live chat with the bot, represented by the Creator's Alter Ego. The bot responds to Fans' comments and questions using the Creator's actual voice, thanks to ElevenLabs' advanced Text to Speech technology.

## Features and Benefits:

1. **Personalized Engagement:** ReacTok enables the bot to provide personalized responses to fans, making each interaction feel unique and special. Fans will feel more connected to the Creator, fostering a sense of community and loyalty.

2. **Monetization Boost:** By guiding non-gifting fans through a conversational process, ReacTok encourages them to participate and send virtual gifts to the bot. The Alter Ego's entertaining responses incentivize fans to become gifting fans, increasing monetization opportunities for the TikTok Creator.

3. **Broadened Reach:** ReacTok helps TikTok Creators expand their fan base by responding in their own voice, even in different languages. For example, if the Creator primarily speaks English, the bot can respond in Hindi, attracting and engaging new fans from diverse linguistic backgrounds.

4. **Customizable Alter Ego:** TikTok Creators have the flexibility to create and customize their Alter Ego, allowing them to craft a unique personality for the bot that aligns with their brand voice, values, and content.

## Product Development Workflow:

1. **Configure the Fine-Tuner.ai Agent:** The Engineering team sets up the Fine-Tuner Agent on its dashboard and obtains its API key.

2. **Build the Streamlit Web App:** The Engineering team creates a Streamlit barebones app with a user-friendly interface that supports chat as input and the audio file/stream as output.

3. **Get Responses from Fine-Tuner API:** Using Fine-Tuner’s REST API, the app fetches responses for the fan’s chat queries from the AI Agent.

4. **Text-to-Speech Conversion:** The app then calls the ElevenLabs API to convert the text response obtained in the previous step into the Creator's voice as an audio file/stream.

5. **Generate Video (Optional):** Optionally, the app can utilize Remotion.dev to create videos using text-to-speech responses and additional content.

6. **Translation (Optional):** For broadening reach, the app can call a Translation API with the text response from step 3 and then pass the translated text to ElevenLabs TTS API to get the response in the voice of the TikTok Creator translated (in Hindi or any other language) as an audio file/stream.
